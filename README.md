# 🔍 Proactive Anomaly Detection for Smart Radiator Efficiency

*A Case Study Initiative by Muhammad Anwar*
**Betterspace GmbH | June 2025**

---

## 📘 About the Project

This project is a self-initiated case study to explore how data science can proactively support **Betterspace GmbH’s mission** of improving energy efficiency in smart buildings. Using simulated sensor data, I developed a pipeline to detect heating inefficiencies, classify anomalies, and visualize trends — all tailored to the smart radiator systems Betterspace offers.

My goal? To demonstrate hands-on capability and curiosity — and to show how I can contribute meaningfully to a real-world, sustainability-focused product.

## 🎯 What This Project Tries to Solve

Using just one week of time-series data from heating sensors, I set out to:

* Identify hidden patterns of **inefficient heating**
* Classify anomalies such as:

  * Heating while the room is **unoccupied**
  * Heating where the **actual temperature lags far behind the set point**
  * **Temperature drifts** when no heating is on
* Deliver insights via **clear dashboards** using Power BI and Python

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Visualization:** Power BI (interactive dashboards)
* **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Highlights & Insights

* **109 anomalies** were flagged, with most linked to ineffective or wasteful heating
* **Room-level analysis** helped spotlight problematic zones
* **Hourly breakdowns** showed off-hours waste patterns
* Dashboards make it easy for teams to act fast and monitor trends

---

## 🏁 What’s Next?

I see big opportunities in scaling this approach for real-time use:

* Integrating **real-time alerting** for maintenance or behavior adjustment
* Adding **weather-based predictive triggers**
* Plug-and-play integration into the **Betterspace Monitor platform**
